        <h2>01. OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p>Chef Koochooloo is an NSF award winning startup that claims to teach
          children Math, Science, Language Arts, and Social Studies with a
          cooking app that incorporates the aforementioned subjects.
          <!-- It also
          claims to teach children about cultural sensitivity, which is a
          challenge considering some of the existing material in the app. -->
        </p>
        <!-- <img class="large_img" src="images/Project3-chefk/twitter.PNG"> -->
        <p>I was hired to be an Instructional Designer, which meant I was in
          charge of creating the curriculum and testing this out to students
          on sites, predominantly in after school programs. Most of the work
          was done remotely, and I kept in touch with the team via Skype and
          text messages. We had periodic in-person meetings in Mountain View
          to discuss the product and its applications. I was also responsible
          for doing UI/UX design and product design for the app, creating the
          mid fidelity mockups that I then passed on to a coworker to turn into
          a high fidelity mockup.

        <h2>02. VISUAL DESIGN</h2>
        <p>
          <!-- It has become a rite of passage of some sort for designers on our
          team to make our own iterations of the characters that represent this
          app.  -->
          Many of the designers have tried their hand in updating the current
          designs for the app. The existing design could definitely be improved,
          so I also participated in it.
          <!-- It’s not very difficult for people to want to make changes to
          the design, when one considers the physical appearance of those
          characters.  -->
          I would like to state that I do not own the rights to
          the following characters used in this app:</p>

      </div>
      <section class="sec2">
        <p>I made my own interpretation of the character featured in the
          product’s logo, using three different design styles. I used Krita, a
          digital painting program, and vector illustration from Figma to make the
          following alternatives:

        alt="image of three character designs - cartoon, semi realistic, and vector">
      </div>
      <section class="sec2">
        <p>While our petitions to redesign the characters have been
          rejected by the CEO, this was a good exercise in
          character design for us.
        </p>
        <p>We were also expected to do visual design for the pitch decks that
          the CEO uses to advertise her company. I have contributed to making
          designs for the slides in the Nestle pitch. This was a team effort,
          and the slides were
          consistently evolving to meet the needs of investors.
        </p>

      <section class="sec" id="sec03">
        <h2>03. CURRICULUM (ITERATION #1)</h2>
        <p>I was responsible for creating recipes that would eventually be
          integrated into the fourth grade course curriculum and eventually
          the app itself. I also redesigned the former slides so that it would
          be more visually appealing and more intuitive.

        <p>I created ten recipes, each a simplified dish from a different
          country. In theory, the students will learn math and science from
          preparing the dish, as both could be needed in order to understand
          the recipe and how the food transforms when it is being cooked. The
          reading comprehension section comes from reading a short story from a
          character explaining what is happening in their country, which could
          then turn into a geography and social studies lesson.

      </section>


    <section class="sec" id="sec04">
      <h2>04. USER TESTING & RESEARCH</h2>
      <p>I was required by the CEO to test the initial fourth grade curriculum
        by teaching them in after school programs. I was assigned to the
        following schools:
      </p>
      <!-- <div class="background"> -->
        <ol>
          <li><span class="bold-me">St Andrew’s</span> (elementary school):
            5-10 kids</li>
          <li><span class="bold-me">St Andrew’s</span> (middle school):
            5-10 kids</li>
          <li><span class="bold-me">Castro Mariano</span> (K-1): 15-20 kids</li>
          <li><span class="bold-me">Castro Mariano</span> (2-3): 15-20 kids</li>
        </ol>
      <!-- </div> -->

      <!-- <p>The first problem is that the original curriculum was made for fourth
        graders, but now is being used for children aged K-8.
        I had to edit the
        materials last minute to make it suitable for younger children, and then
        do it again for the older children.
        The second problem is that teaching
        a class of three children requires a completely different approach than
        a class of twenty children.</p>
      <p>The St. Andrew’s classes were on the small side, from 3-5 students,
        while Castro Mariano classes were around 15-20. The app could function
        as an after school cooking class, but it cannot be used to teach new
        material if the target audience does not include actual fourth graders.
        Moreover, in classes that ranged from 15-20 children, my focus was on
        controlling the classroom rather than teaching. It is also difficult to
        involve that many children in the cooking process, in addition to the
        fact that the classroom could attract ants and cockroaches if the food
        isn’t cleaned up properly. Given that I was working with very young
        children, there was a lot of mess that we couldn’t always clean up
        afterwards.</p>
      <p>The app is originally supposed to be for children as young as kindergarteners, and
        ideally have the teachers lead the classroom and use the app to teach
        students, but keeping track of the food for an entire classroom adds to
        the teachers’ cognitive load and requires that they bring in kitchen
        supplies such as ovens and pans that are not found in a traditional
        classroom. There is also the issue of how there are too many subjects
        that need to be covered when the class lasts an hour. Having taught Math
        and English/Social Studies in tutoring centers and private schools, I am
        skeptical that any teacher can successfully teach multiple subjects in
        the course of an hour since there is no way for them to cover the
        material with much depth.</p>
      <p>My assessment is that this could work solely as a cooking class for older children, where
        students learn how to navigate in the kitchen and be exposed to cooking.
        This can function as an after school class, but it would be very challenging
        to implement this within a traditional classroom setting. </p> -->
      <p>I observed how the students interacted with the course, and made note
        of any issues that came up within the existing curriculum. I also worked
        with another UX Designer, who came in as a researcher, to make our
        assessments on the efficacy of the program.</p>

    <section class="sec" id="sec05">
      <h2>05. CURRICULUM (ITERATION #2)</h2>
      <p>During the process of translating the recipes into the app, I was given
        a guideline that I was expected to follow in order to create
        the fourth grade curriculum that would be used in the final product. The curriculum had to include
        NGSS/ELA/Common Core standards, as
          well as IB standards.
      </p>
        <!-- We
        know that many people are struggling with the American curriculum
        because it is relatively new, especially regarding Common Core, which
        has been criticized by some teachers for being confusing.
        Moreover,  -->
        <!-- Due to this difference, it is
        questionable whether we can combine them, because it is likely we would have to compromise the
        standards for both curricula and ultimately end up with something that
        cannot meet either standards.</p>
      <p>My assessment is that it would be better to focus on just one country
        requirement, but it was rejected, so I moved on to work on the
        curriculum, which was challenging when there is little to
        no material in the states about IB standards. -->
        <!-- The local library, for
        instance, has zero books and zero practice tests about the IB standards,
         and on the internet, access is limited behind a firewall.  -->
      <!-- <p>However, the problem with the guideline that she gave me is that the
        questions she wanted on the app are inadequate for a fourth grade
        curriculum. For instance, in the math section, there were rulers with
        questions asking how many inches were on it; alternatively, there were
        bowls filled with some substance with questions asking if it's halfway
        full or empty and so on. If you are asking a fourth grader how many
        inches are in a ruler, you are not giving a math assessment, you are
        giving a vision test. </p> -->
      <p>In the current iteration, there is a lot of room for
        improvement regarding the content we created with the guidelines we were given.
        As of now, the
        <!-- lack of corporate
        interest in addressing those concerns, I simply had to make do.
        The -->
        curriculum could work as a review or refresher for students who have
        already mastered the subjects, but it cannot be used to teach new
        material.</p>

      <h2>06. LOW FIDELITY</h2>
      <p>
        <!-- There’s a conversation to be had about corporate leadership who are
        involved in education and technology startups but have no knowledge in
        either subject, and how this affects their ability to manage their team.
        For instance, -->
        <!-- my favorite moments were when  -->
        <!-- the CEO once called the MongoDB
        database a coding language and claimed the product was an “AI gamified
        app” when it was coded with Ruby and HAXE. -->
        <!-- It was a lot less funny for
        me when  -->
        <!-- There was also the fact that she told me to create the high fidelity
        mockup of the entire 4th
        grade curriculum of the app in three days, which is simply not possible.  -->
        There was a rush to produce the app earlier than expected, and we were
        instructed to complete the high fidelity mockups in three days. This is,
        of course, a very challenging and ambitious goal. </p>
      </p>

    </section>

    alt="lo fi images of the app">
    <section class="sec2">
      <p>Fortunately, the previous UX designer started a portion of the lo-fi
        mockup that I was able to use in order to quickly make a lo-fi mockup of
        five lesson plans. Unfortunately, she also deviated from
        the style guide created by product designers for the app. From my
        conversation with her, the UX designer created the parent/teacher portal
        and wanted the student portal to complement it, and thought that the
        style guide was inadequate for that. Therefore, I decided to combine
        elements of the style guide with the modifications she made, which was
        how I ended up being the product designer. </p>
    </section>

    <section class="sec" id="sec07">
      <h2>07. MID FIDELITY</h2>
      <p>As the product designer, I created the mid-fi mockups and drafted a new
        style guide that incorporated elements from the old style guide and the
        new interpretation from the previous UX designer so that it could
        complement the parent/teacher portal.
      </p>
      <p>Besides staying in contact with the previous UX designer, I was also
        telling the illustrator what images we need to complete the high
        fidelity mockup, which would then be completed by another UX designer. I gave
        him the instructions about the new style guide, and design
        recommendations that would be different from what already exists in the
        app.</p>

      <h2>WHAT I LEARNED</h2>
      <p>I was able to work quickly in a high pressure environment, and work
        well with team members despite the fact that we were working remotely.
        I was successfully able to complete the mid-fi mockups for the Japan
        lesson only because I was connected to the team members, and was able to
        clearly communicate the issues in hand as well as what I needed.
      </p>
      <p>I was also able to be flexible and fulfil roles that I was not
        expecting to do. I did not think I would be a product designer or a product
        manager, but ended up being in that position because the need was there,
        and I took the initiative to take over that role.
      </p>
      <p>
        <!-- Finally, I learned how to navigate around people who were
        preventing
        this product from being completed in order to successfully
        unable to help this product move forward in order to successfully finish the
        task at hand.  -->
        Overall, it was a challenging experience, but it showed I was able
        to take on a bigger responsibility than I expected, and rise up to the
        occasion when the situation calls for it.
