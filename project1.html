      <!-- OVERVIEW-->
      <section class="sec" id="sec01">
        <h2>01. OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p>When this project started, I was asked to build a cloud storage program
          that allowed users to the following things:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Save content from the internet</li>
          <li>Organize content</li>
          <li>Create content or uploading files from a hard drive</li>
          <li>Share items from the cloud to other people and collaborate</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There was not a lot of specific directives to follow regarding this
          process outside the objectives stated above. However, after going
          through several different iterations of the possible directions for this
          program’s brand, I decided on MemeFolder, a program that allows users to
          save image reactions and gifs from the internet and organize them into
          folders. It also allows users to edit image files so that they can
          create their own memes, as well as share them with friends.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!--PROBLEM-->
      <section class="sec" id="sec02">
        <h2>02. PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>I got my inspiration for this program from two places:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>A viral image which shows an individual struggling to find an image
          reaction due to their highly disorganized and overcrowded folder
          </li>
          <li>Under viral twitter tweets, users would respond with humerous gifs,
          and other users would request for the original poster to share how they
          found that gif
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The MemeFolder should allow users to address both
          problems, which appear to happen rather frequently online.
          For many Millennial users, social media is an integral part of their
          lives, and as such it becomes necessary to be knowledgeable of meme
          culture as a visual style of communication. Considering the
          proliferation of meme formats available, it can become frustrating for
          users to find and keep track of existing memes in their phones or
          desktop; it can also be equally frustrating for users who are unable to
          find the memes or gifs that they want, as there is no easy way to easily
          get these image files directly from social media sites.
        </p>

      <!--USER SURVEY-->

      <section class="sec" id="sec03">
        <h2>03. USER SURVEY</h2>
          <p>The user survey was created before the branding was established. I
            wrote the questions assuming that I will be creating a generic cloud
            storage program. The results I got from the people who completed the
            survey went as follows:
          </p>

        <p>My intention was to create a cloud storage that addressed the
          aforementioned issues, which is evident in early prototypes. However,
          the idea for the meme editing feature came because
          100% of the surveyed
          users are active participants of social media.

      <h2>05. COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h2>
      <p>I chose Google Drive and Dropbox, which are two of the most popular
        cloud storage devices. I also chose to compare it with Amazon Drive,
        as it is an atypical cloud storage device that sells photo albums based
        on the pictures that users upload to this device. I wanted something
        unusual to compare with more traditional cloud storages to see how it
        would do in comparison.

      <h2>09. BRANDING</h2>
      <p>The style guide went through three iterations as I developed the brand
        for this cloud storage device.
      </p>
      <p>The first iteration was called
        <span class="bold-me">MyCloud</span>, which was a generic device that
        allowed users to upload files and organize them in folders, as well as
        share them with friends. It offered one file editing program, which
        allowed users to edit pictures and make their own memes, in deference to
        the Millennial/Gen Z majority that took my survey. After completing the
        prototype, I realized that I should commit to this direction, and
        rebranded my program.
      </p>
      <p>This resulted in the second iteration
        <span class="bold-me">MyFolder</span>, which is a cloud
        storage specifically made to collect and organize memes, gifs, and
        reaction images, mostly for the purpose of social media. This is an
        app-only program also allows users to create their own memes and share
        it with friends.
      </p>
      <p>After making more changes to the brand, I came up with
        <span class="bold-me">MemeFolder</span> in
        the third iteration. It has the same functionality as MyFolder, but with
        minor changes in the logo and color scheme.
      </p>
    </section>


      <!--11. STYLE GUIDE-->
    <section class="sec" id="sec10">
    <h2>10. BRAINSTORM</h2>
      <p>I started off with the sketch for my generic cloud storage, which
        included several logos that revolves around the cloud and sun imagery.
        I eventually settled on the one that led to the MyCloud logo, which
        represents the first iteration of this project.
      </p>
      <img src="images/Project1/StyleGuide/LogoSketch.jpg" class="sketch">
      <p>I also drew a brainstorm that detailed the directions that this product
        can go to, and it’s from here that I came across the idea that meme
        editing could be included in the app, which was included in the MyCloud
        prototype and eventually became the focus of the brand that was to be
        MyFolder.
      </p>
      <img src="images/Project1/StyleGuide/Brainstorm.jpg" class="sketch">
      <p>From these sketches, I created the next three iterations of my
        cloud storage app. In the following section, I’ve included the style
        guides for all of them, which includes
        MyCloud,
        MyFolder, and finally,
        MemeFolder.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="sec" id="sec11">
      <h2>11. STYLE GUIDE</h2>
      <p>For the <span class="bold-me">MyCloud</span>
        iteration, I created the following logo and the color
        scheme that was to go with it, as well as the chosen font:
      </p>
      <img src="images/Project1/StyleGuide/MyCloud.png" class="large_img">
      <p>I went with blue and yellow to convey the sky to match the cloud brand,
        and included darker red and green to give the program a neutral
        appearance since I believed the aforementioned colors to be too bright.
        For the font, I went with Righteous for the rounded edges to match the
        curves in the logo.
      </p>
      <p>For the <span class="bold-me">MyFolder</span>
        iteration, I created the following logo and color
        scheme, as well as the chosen font:
      </p>
      <img src="images/Project1/StyleGuide/MyFolder.png" class="large_img">
      <p>I chose more dramatic colors to catch the eyes of a younger audience,
        focusing primarily on the contrast between dark grey and pink. I also
        chose Dosis for the logo’s font, as its much narrower appearance gives
        it a sleeker and more modern look. The change in the logo, a smiley face
        superimposed on a folder, is a reflection of how users will be able to
        pull image reactions from this folder in order to convey their emotions
        on social media.
      </p>
      <p>For the <span class="bold-me">MemeFolder</span></span>
        iteration, I created the following logo and color
        scheme, as well as the chosen font:
      </p>
      <img src="images/Project1/StyleGuide/MemeFolder.png" class="large_img">
      <img src="images/Project1/StyleGuide/MemeFolder2.png" class="large_img">
      <p>I made minor changes to the logo to make it look minimalistic without
        appearing to be childish, and added different variations of what it
        could look like under different circumstances. There are also minor color
        changes, as I chose a marginally darker grey to provide a greater
        contrast with the pink. The fonts have remained unchanged.
      </p>
      <p>Later on, I also made changes to the logo, which was still too basic.
        I based the changes on the robot emoji, since I thought it would be
        appropriate given that memes are an alternative form of communicating
        emotions in the age of social media, and that this is only possible
        through a technological medium.</p>

    <section class="sec" id="sec12">
      <h2>12. USER TESTING</h2>
      <p>In this section, I’ve included the user testing for all three
        iterations of the program.
      </p>
      <p>For the <span class="bold-me">MyCloud</span></span>
        iteration, I meant to create a desktop version with a
        mobile app. In the inital testing, I looked at different preferences
        users have with:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Column width</li>
          <li>Whether the stars should be located before or after the file name</li>
          <li>Width of the password recovery email request</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Based on the result of the preference test, people preferred:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>A narrow left hand column</li>
          <li>The star located before the file name</li>
          <li>A narrow password recovery email request</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I used the following three slides in the preference test. The
        images on the right
        were the ones favored by people who participated in the test, and were
        ultimately included in the final version of the first, low-fidelity
        prototype. The prototypes for the desktop and mobile versions are included.

        ended up removing both and putting the features in the side bar instead.

    <h2>WHAT I LEARNED</h2>
      <p>
        Working on this project taught me that the process of developing a brand
        requires several iterations in order to focus on a particular direction.
        I realized after finishing this project that the initial direction that
        I wanted this project to go to may not be where it ends up, and that I
        needed to be flexible when I noticed that I can make changes that could
        improve the program itself, whether it is to sharpen its image or make
        its purpose more cohesive for users.</p>
        <p>It also required tenacity, in that
        I had to be willing to redo the work that I had done in order to reflect
        the change in direction; I was initially resistant to this because I
        wanted to avoid doing more work that would be needed when I changed my
        brand direction, but embracing this has allowed me to make a stronger
        product. And even now, looking at MemeFolder, I am still thinking of
        ways I can improve the logo or enhance the prototype and include new
        features that users may want. </p>
        <!-- <p>I have desisted for now, simply because
        there are other projects that I would like to spend my energy on, but
        working on this app has taught me that there can always be improvements
        and iterations that can make this project better for my users.
