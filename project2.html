      <!--02. OVERVIEW-->
      <section class="sec" id="sec01">
      <h2>01. OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p>Astrology is a very popular subject, especially among Millennials and
          Generation Z, many of whom use it to determine relationship
          compatibility. However, despite the popularity of dating apps, there
          are no dating apps that include astrology in it as a key component.
          Thus, my StarCrossed app is meant to unify astrology and dating into a
          singular app. Users can use this app to not only understand astrology
          and keep up with horoscopes, but connect with people based on
          astrological and personal compatibility.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!--03. PROBLEM-->
      <section class="sec" id="sec02">
        <h2>02.PROBLEM</h2>
          <p>While there are many astrology apps and dating apps available, many
            users are dissatisfied with both. For astrology apps, most users feel
            that they do not understand enough about astrology to understand how
            to apply it to their lives. For dating apps, many users, particularly
            women, do not feel comfortable using them because of online harassment
            and concerns with safety. As such, StarCrossed aims to not only merge
            the two subjects into a single app, but to provide a positive
            experience for everyone who wants to use it.

      <!--04. USER SURVEY-->
      <section class="sec" id="sec03">
        <h2>03. USER SURVEY</h2>
          <p>When I wrote the survey, I wanted there to be space such that in
            the event that there was not a market for astrology dating apps, I
            could use the information to go into a different direction with this
            project. The results I got from the people who completed the survey
            went as follows:

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>From the responses, it is clear that there is a market for this
            kind of app among astrology users, especially if they use it to
            figure out aspects of their individual personality. It is also
            important to note that for respondants who are not connected with
            astrology,
            81.8% of people
            are open to using an astrology app
            provided that it explains to them what different astrology terms
            mean, as well as the purpose of the different signs within their
            natal chart. This is determined by one's location and time of birth,
            and is meant to explain the intricacies of one's personality. This
            is to say that if the app provides educational material about how
            astrology works, it may garner interest from people who are both
            passingly familiar with astrology and already invested in astrology.

      <p>The wireframes are made based on the sitemap and provides very
        limited features. I have tested this with users, and while most can
        figure out how to navigate the app, those who have limited knowledge
        about astrology seem to be the most confused as to how to navigate
        these wireframes since the explanations about the signs are not there,
        but are represented as a block.

      <h2>10. BRAINSTORM</h2>
      <p>I made several sketches for a potential logo, playing off the name
        "star crossed." I was aiming for something that captures the essense
        of an astrology/dating branding without being too cheesy.
      </p>
      <img src="images/Project2/brainstorm.png" class="sketch">
      <p>I eventually went with the star surrounded by twelve "mini-stars"
        represented as dots, with each of them representing one of the twelve
        signs of the zodiac. Here is a preliminary design that shows the
        dimensions of the first iteration of my logo.

      <h2>11. BRANDING</h2>
      <p>I made a mood board to get a sense of what kind of brand I should
        develop for the app. Looking at different images, I found that for
        astrology related subjects, I leaned towards using darker
        colors to represent the night sky.

    <img src="images/Project2/moodboard.PNG" class="large_img">
    <section class="sec2">
      <p>I incorporated the color scheme into my style guide and my logo,
        using dark blue colors. For font choice, I went with Inconsolata and
        Special Elite because of how they resemble typewriting fonts. I chose
        them because it conveyed an old-fashioned vibe that complemented the
        longevity of astrology.

      <p>The <span class="bold-me">first iteration</span>
         of the high fidelity mockup was made with bare
        minimum aesthetics based on the wireframes. The initial appearance is

        <p>The <span class="bold-me">second iteration</span>
          was spent making adjustments to the previous iteration and making
          changes that would help users navigate this site.
        </p>
        <p>One of the first changes I made was for a user who had large fingers,
          and has trouble using small buttons. I increased the size of the
          buttons that are meant to approve or reject potential matches to suit
          their needs. The larger buttons I ultimately chose to use are at the
          <span class="bold-me">right hand side</span>.

      <section class="sec2">
        <p>I also made minor design changes in areas such as the new user
          questionnaire section, in which I changed the "other" designation in
          gender to "custom" to be more inclusive towards gender non-conforming
          people. I am still not very satisfied with this method of gender
          categorization, and it is something to look into if I were to do
          future iterations of this project. I also changed the radial buttons,
          which generally is used to select a single option, to a checkbox to
          indicate users can choose more than one option. The final design
          choice is on the

        <p>Moreover, as I started to incorporate the branding into the prototype,
          I found that some users had trouble with the design choices I made.
          For instance, I used a glowing effect to mimic that of stars in the
          night sky to stand out against the dark colors. However, some users
          had trouble visually processing this app, as it produced a blurring
          effect for them that makes it difficult to read. In deference to this,
          I took the advice of one user who suggested that limiting the glowing
          effect inside the button could make this more readable for them. The
          final design choice is on the

        <p>There was also a series of minor adjustments I made
          for this app to be more inclusive, and the one that sticks out the
          most was made by an airline assistant. Because she is constantly
          traveling and has an unreliable location, distance is a tricky area
          for her because she could be at different states at different times.
          As such, I significantly increased the maximum distance so that people
          with similar professions could also use this app. The final design
          choice is on the

      <h2>WHAT I LEARNED</h2>
      <p>
        I was unfamiliar with iOS as someone who only used android my entire
        life, and I am unfamiliar with both astrology and dating apps. This
        made it a challenging project in that I was doing something with
        subjects that I do not have much prior knowledge to. I did think I was
        over in my head when I first did this, so I was surprised by how well
        this all came together, considering that I was not really sure what I
        was doing in the process of creating this prototype. This helped me
        feel more confident in my ability to tackle projects that are outside
        my comfort zone.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also found that I was able to create prototypes much faster than
        before, and do a better job in directing users in the directions I
        want them to take when they are navigating through my app. I could see
        the improvements I made in designing and organizing my projects in
        comparison with the previous one I was invested in, so it was
        encouraging for me to see that I have grown somewhat as a designer.
      </p>
      <p>I also see the areas in this project where there is room for
        improvement. I stopped at the iteration where I am at right now, but I
        think being aware that there is always more that I can do with this
        project can be helpful in making better products.
